**alttab** is X11 window switcher designed for minimalistic window managers
or standalone X11 session.
```
  alttab  [-w N] [-d N] [-sc N] [-mk <str>] [-kk <str>] [-bk <str>]
  [-pk <str>] [-nk <str>] [-ck <str>] [-dk <str>] [-mm <N>] [-bm <N>]
  [-t NxM] [-i NxM] [-vp str] [-p str] [-s N] [-theme name] [-bg color]
  [-fg color] [-frame color] [-inact color] [-bc color] [-bw <N>]
  [-font name] [-vertical] [-e] [-b N] [-ns] [-v|-vv]
```
(see man page for details)

Unlike task switchers integrated in most simple window managers (WM) or
dmenu-like switchers, alttab features visual interface and convenient
tactile behaviour: press modifier (Alt) - multiple switch with
a key (Tab) - release modifier.
Also, it's lightweight and depends only on basic X11 libs, conforming
to the usage of lightweight WM.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/sagb/alttab.git
cd alttab
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details, [doc/wm-setup.md](doc/wm-setup.md)
for window manager settings,
[doc/mobile.md](doc/mobile.md) for usage on mobile devices.

Usually it should run fully functional without any argument: `alttab`.
